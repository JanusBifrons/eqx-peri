// Test script documenting the new realistic missile behavior
console.log('🚀 New Missile Behavior System');

console.log('\n📋 Missile Launch Phases:');

console.log('\n🎯 TORPEDO BEHAVIOR:');
console.log('  Phase 1 (0-0.5s): Launch acceleration (1.5x thrust)');
console.log('  Phase 2 (0.5s+): Cruise at steady speed (0.6x thrust)');
console.log('  • Flies straight with no steering');
console.log('  • Gives targets 0.5 seconds to react and evade');

console.log('\n🔥 HEAT SEEKER BEHAVIOR:');
console.log('  Phase 1 (0-0.3s): Launch acceleration (1.5x thrust, no seeking)');
console.log('  Phase 2 (0.3-1.0s): Cruise and search (0.8x thrust)');
console.log('  Phase 3 (target found): FULL THROTTLE pursuit (2.0x thrust + steering)');
console.log('  Phase 4 (target lost): Return to cruise (0.6x thrust)');
console.log('  • 300px detection radius');
console.log('  • Gives targets 0.3 seconds to juke and avoid detection');

console.log('\n🎯 GUIDED MISSILE BEHAVIOR:');
console.log('  Phase 1 (0-0.3s): Launch acceleration (1.5x thrust, no steering)');
console.log('  Phase 2 (valid target): FULL THROTTLE pursuit (2.0x thrust + steering)');
console.log('  Phase 3 (no target): Cruise straight (0.6x thrust)');
console.log('  • Uses pre-locked target from launch');
console.log('  • Gives targets 0.3 seconds to break lock or take evasive action');

console.log('\n⚙️ Technical Improvements:');
console.log('  • Zero friction (frictionAir: 0) for realistic space physics');
console.log('  • Low initial velocity (3 units) with rapid acceleration');
console.log('  • Phase-based thrust control integrated into steering logic');
console.log('  • Angular velocity-based turning for smooth physics');
console.log('  • Target acquisition tracking for intelligent behavior');

console.log('\n🎮 Gameplay Benefits:');
console.log('  • Targets have time to react and perform evasive maneuvers');
console.log('  • Missiles are more visible during their approach');
console.log('  • Creates tactical decisions about when to fire');
console.log('  • Different missile types have distinct behavior patterns');
console.log('  • More realistic acceleration curves');

console.log('\n✅ Test by:');
console.log('  1. Load the Missile Corvette');
console.log('  2. Fire at targets and observe the launch sequence');
console.log('  3. Watch missiles accelerate slowly then go full throttle when they acquire targets');
console.log('  4. Try evasive maneuvers to juke incoming missiles during their launch phase');

// Test the math for the different phases
console.log('\n🧮 Thrust Calculations:');
